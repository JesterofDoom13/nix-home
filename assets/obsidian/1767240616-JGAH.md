# Font Sizes

## For #GTK Based Apps

When launching apps that are based in #GTK you add the following to the environment:

```bash
GDK_DPI_SCALE=0.8
```

You can add that to their environment box in KDE Menu Editor by
right-clicking on their app in the application menu and editing
application.

Or you can set it as a precursor to calling the command in the terminal
