## 📝 Journal Entry & Reflection

### What Happened Today?

> [!QUESTION] [Record key events or observations in bullet points]

Was a Lazy day since it is a holiday and all. Spent the day in my room
watching anime. #ChainsawMan was what I watched. Finished the one season
they have of it.

Having some issues with getting the Silk PLA+ going. I have heard it can
be very tricky to print this stuff so I should be patient with myself.
I need to probably dry the filament.

The fan might also be busted... 🙁

Found out I shouldn't have washed anything today. Including the dishes.
Which I did wash my pan earlier after cooking some chicken tacos in it.

### One Thing I Am Grateful For

> [!QUESTION] [Write a sentence or two about something you appreciate]

I appreciate the cute gift they got me for Christmas. It sits here smiling at me.
I appreciate what my sister does to spend time with me. She wants to go visit family
we haven't spent a lot of time with.

### How Am I Feeling Today?

> [!QUESTION] [Describe your thoughts and emotions to understand them more clearly]

I'm glad I can get some of the stuff I'm working on to work with the 3D Printer.
It was stressful when things didn't work out. Everything takes time and I should
be more patient. It's a good stressor for me to have some things go wrong and
stick to it.
