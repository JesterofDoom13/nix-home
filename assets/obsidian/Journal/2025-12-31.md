## 📅 Daily Log

### **Sleep:**

#### **Quality:**

I wanted more of it because it felt so nice and comfy. I was feeling like I
was getting good rest until my alarm started going off.

#### **Dreams:**

I was dreaming about adjusting my #Nix configuration but I knew that I was
dreaming, so I know that it was all for nothing. There was no guarantee it
would actually work if I remembered it and I was pretty confident I wasn't
going to remember it. Which I don't. So I did wake up from my dream because
it wasn't working but I had to force myself to stop dreaming about it to
finally stop waking up constantly.

### **Mood:**

> [!QUESTION] [e.g., 😊 Happy, 😌 Calm, 💡 Reflective]

### 🚀 Today's Priorities
